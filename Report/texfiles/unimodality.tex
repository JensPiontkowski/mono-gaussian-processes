\section{Unimodality constraint using Monotonicity}
Using monotonicity constraints shown above, we can model unimodality by modeling a latent parameter symbolizing the mode and changing the enfocrced sign of the derivative across it. For our experiments we performed tried three models enforcing unimodality and compared it against the normal GP model. Three methods for enforce unimodality are were designed as shown below.

\subsection{Using a linear function to model the sign of derivative}
Using a linear line parameterized by the slope and intercept parameters to model the derivative information.
