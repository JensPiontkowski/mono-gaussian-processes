\section{Introduction}
Gaussian processes are probabilistic models which offer a non parameteric fully bayesian framework for learning a regression task. The prior information is usually encoded within the choice of the mean and covariance functions along with the hyperparameters of these function. The prior choice of monotonicity constraint was shown to be enforcable with the use of psuedo inputs, Gaussian process derivatives and using a sigmoidal link function to enforce the derivatives are of a given sign. \cite{JaaAki10}. In this project we try extend the monotonicity constraint enforce a unimodality constraint.
